\title{Score Gene-Path Clusters in MemPlotFolio}
\usage{
score_gene_path_clusters(Mpf, set_fraction = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Mpf}{\code{MemPlotFolio} with \code{Clusters()} and \code{GeneClusters()} used
to define pathway (set) clusters, and gene clusters, respectively.
The data are taken from the \code{GenePathHeatmap()} heatmap data,
which are equivalent to using the \code{memIM(Mem)} gene-pathway
incidence matrix data.}

\item{set_fraction}{\code{numeric} value, default 0.5, indicating the fraction
of pathways in a pathway cluster at or above which a gene is required
to be present for that gene to contribute to the gene-pathway cluster
score.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are ignored.}
}
\value{
\code{matrix} of numeric values ranging from 0 to 1, reflecting
the fraction of genes with at least \code{set_fraction} representation
in each pathway cluster. The columns are pathway clusters, and
rows are gene clusters.

Score Gene-Path Clusters in MemPlotFolio, still in development
}
\details{
This function provides a quick summary of the "cohesiveness"
of gene-pathway clustering, using a basic metric to summarize
the fraction of genes represented in each pathway cluster.

The summary may be useful to identify "hot spots" in a gene-pathway
heatmap, which may itself be useful to identify functional
hubs which may be broadly shared across numerous pathways.

The simple metric appears effective at identifying gene clusters
which are populated by the majority of genes, and therefore could
be the basis for understanding the nature of common genes associated
with multiple pathways.
It also appears interesting to observe pathway clusters,
some of which have one or more gene clusters with high gene-path cluster
scores, and some which have moderate gene-path cluster scores across
numerous gene clusters. The latter case may be an artifact of
small pathway clusters, in which case a better metric should
be evaluated.
