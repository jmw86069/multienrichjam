\arguments{
\item{ipaFile}{one of the four input types described above:
a character vector of text file names; a character vector of
Excel \code{.xlsx} file names; a list of \code{data.frame} objects.}

\item{headerGrep}{regular expression pattern used to
recognize header columns found in Ingenuity IPA enrichment data.}

\item{ipaNameGrep}{vector of regular expression patterns
used to recognize the name of the enriched entity,
for example the biological pathway, or network, or
disease category, etc.}

\item{geneGrep}{regular expression pattern used to recognize
the column containing genes, or the molecules tested for
enrichment which were found in the enriched entity.}

\item{geneCurateFrom, geneCurateTo}{vector of patterns and
replacements, respectively, used to curate values in
the gene column. These replacement rules are used to
ensure that genes are delimited consistently, with no
leading or trailing delimiters.}

\item{method}{integer value indicating the method used to
import data from a text file, where: \code{method=1} uses
\code{data.table::read.table()} and the \code{textConnection} argument;
\code{method=2} uses \code{readr::read_tsv()}. The motivation to use
\code{data.table::read.table()} is it performed better in the
presence of UTF-8 characters such as the alpha symbol.}

\item{sheet}{integer value used only when \code{ipaFile} is
a vector of Excel \code{.xlsx} files, and when the Excel
format includes multiple worksheets. This value will
extract enrichment data only from one worksheet from
each Excel file.}

\item{sep}{character string used when \code{ipaFile} is a vector
of text files, to split fields into columns. The default
will split fields by the tab character.}

\item{xlsxMultiSheet}{logical indicating whether input
Excel \code{.xlsx} files contain multiple worksheets.}

\item{useXlsxSheetNames}{logicl indicating whether to use the
Excel worksheet name for each imported enrichment table,
when importing from \code{.xlsx} files, and when
\code{xlsxMultiSheet=FALSE}. When \code{xlsxMultiSheet=TRUE} the
name is derived from the value matched using \code{ipaNameGrep},
because in this case, there are expected to me multiple
enrichment tables in one worksheet.}

\item{remove_blank_colnames}{\code{logical} indicating whether to drop
\code{colnames()} where all values are contained in \code{c(NA, "")}.
This option may be preferable \code{remove_blank_colnames=FALSE}
when all values in some column like \code{zScore} are \code{NA}, but
you would still like to retain the column for consistency
with other data. We found that IPA does not report \code{zScore}
values when there are only 4 or fewer genes involved in
each enrichment result.}

\item{convert_ipa_slash}{\code{logical} indicating whether to convert
IPA gene naming conventions, currently some genes are considered
one entity in the IPA system, for example \code{"HSPA1A/HSPA1B"} is
considered one gene, even though two Entrez gene entries
\code{"HSPA1A"} and \code{"HSPA1B"} can be represented. Regardless whether
one or both genes are provided to IPA, it considers it one
entity for the purpose of pathway enrichment hypergeometric testing.
Unfortunately, the forward slash \code{"/"} is also used by
\code{clusterProfiler} object \code{enrichResult} as gene delimiter, and
is hard-coded and cannot be changed. So it will automatically
consider \code{"HSPA1A/HSPA1B"} as two genes, causing a mismatch with
the IPA results.
When \code{convert_ipa_slash=TRUE} by default, it converts the
forward slash \code{"/"} to the value of argument \code{ipa_slash_sep}.}

\item{ipa_slash_sep}{\code{character} string used as a delimited when
\code{convert_ipa_slash=TRUE}, used to replace genes that contain
forward slash \code{"/"} to use another character.}

\item{revert_ipa_xref}{\code{logical} indicating whether to revert the
IPA gene symbols reported, which requires that the IPA data
contains a section \code{"Analysis Ready Molecules"}.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether to print verbose output.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are ignored.}

\value{
\code{list} of \code{data.frame} objects, where each \code{data.frame}
contains enrichment data for one of the Ingenuity IPA
enrichment tests.
}
\description{
Import Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 'IPA' results
}
\details{
This function parses Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ('IPA')
enrichment data into a \code{list} of enrichment \code{data.frame}
objects for downstream analysis. Each \code{data.frame}
represents the results of one Ingenuity IPA section, however
not all sections represent statistical results.
\subsection{Motivation}{
\enumerate{
\item Separate multiple IPA enrichment tables.
\item Rename colnames to be consistent.
\item Revert IPA gene aliases to original user input (optional).
}
}

\subsection{Input format}{
\enumerate{
\item \code{ipaFile} can be a text \code{.txt} file,
where the text file contains all IPA enrichment data in
tall format. This format is most common.
\item \code{ipaFile} can be an Excel \code{.xlsx} file,
which contains all IPA enrichment data in
one tall worksheet tab.
\item \code{ipaFile} can be an Excel \code{.xlsx} file,
where each type of IPA enrichment appears on a separate
Excel worksheet tab.
\item \code{ipaFile} can be a list of \code{data.frame} objects.
This option is intended when the IPA data has already
been imported into R as separate \code{data.frame} objects.
}
}

\subsection{Notes}{

When using \code{"Export All"} from 'IPA', the default text format
includes multiple enrichment tables concatenated together in one
file. Each enrichment table contains its own unique column
headers, with descriptive text in the line preceding the
column headers. This function is intended to separate the
enrichment tables into a list of \code{data.frame} objects, and
retain the descriptive text as names of the list.
}

\subsection{Troubleshooting}{
\itemize{
\item A common error occurs when reverting IPA gene symbols
to the original user-supplied identifier, by default
\code{revert_ipa_xref=TRUE}.
For errors during this step, consider \code{revert_ipa_xref=FALSE}
which will retain the gene symbol as recognized by IPA.
The downside of this approach is that it may be more difficult
to equate to the input identifier.
In that case look at the "Analysis Ready Molecules" \code{data.frame}
which should contain the
user-provided values as "ID"; the IPA recognized symbol as "Name",
and optionally a column "Symbol" which is edited by multienrichjam.
