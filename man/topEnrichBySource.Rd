\arguments{
\item{enrichDF}{\code{data.frame} containing enrichment results.}

\item{n}{\code{integer} maximum number of pathways to retain,
after applying \code{min_count} and \code{p_cutoff} thresholds
if relevant.}

\item{min_count}{\code{integer} minimum number of genes involved
in an enrichment result to be retained, based upon values
in \code{countColname}.}

\item{p_cutoff}{\code{numeric} value indicating the enrichment
P-value threshold, pathways with enrichment P-value at
or below this threshold are retained, based upon values
in \code{pvalueColname}.}

\item{sourceColnames}{character vector of colnames in
\code{enrichDF} to consider as the \code{"Source"}. Multiple
columns will be combined using delimiter argument
\code{sourceSep}. When \code{sourceColnames} is NULL or
contains no \code{colnames(enrichDF)}, then data
is considered \code{"All"}.}

\item{sortColname}{character vector indicating the colnames
to use to sort data, prior to selecting the top \code{n}
results by source. This argument is passed to
\code{jamba::mixedSortDF(x, byCols=sortColname)}. Columns
can be sorted in reverse order by using the prefix \code{"-"},
as described in \code{jamba::mixedSortDF()}.}

\item{countColname}{\code{character} vector of possible colnames
in \code{enrichDF} that should contain the \code{integer} number
of genes involved in enrichment. This vector is
passed to \code{find_colname()} to find an appropriate
matching colname in \code{enrichDF}.}

\item{pvalueColname}{\code{character} vector of possible colnames
in \code{enrichDF} that should contain the enrichment P-value
used for filtering by \code{p_cutoff}.}

\item{newColname}{new column name to use when \code{sourceColname}
matches multiple colnames in \code{enrichDF}. Values for each
row are combined using \code{jamba::pasteByRow()}.}

\item{curateFrom, curateTo}{character vectors with
pattern,replacement values, passed to \code{gsubs()}
to allow some editing of values. The default values
convert MSigDB canonical pathways from the prefix \code{"CP:"}
to use \code{"CP"} which has the effect of combining all
canonical pathways before selecting the top \code{n} results.}

\item{sourceSubset}{character vector with a subset of
sources to retain. If there are multiple colnames in
\code{sourceColnames}, then column values are combined
using \code{jamba::pasteByRow()} and delimiter \code{sourceSep},
prior to filtering.}

\item{sourceSep}{character string used as a delimiter
when \code{sourceColnames} contains multiple colnames.}

\item{descriptionColname, nameColname}{character vectors
indicating the colnames to consider description and name,
as returned from \code{find_colname()}. These arguments are
used only when \code{descriptionGrep} or \code{nameGrep} are
supplied.}

\item{descriptionGrep, nameGrep}{character vector of patterns, used
to filter pathways to those matching one or more patterns.
This argument is used to help extract a specific subset
of pathways of interest using keywords.
The \code{descriptionGrep} argument searches only \code{descriptionColname};
the \code{nameGrep} argument searches only \code{nameColname}.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether to print verbose output.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are ignored.}

\item{enrichList}{\code{list} of \code{enrichDF} entries, each passed
to \code{topEnrichBySource()}.}
}
\value{
\code{data.frame} subset up to \code{topEnrichN} rows, after
applying optional \code{min_count} and \code{p_cutoff} filters.

\description{
Subset enrichList for top enrichment results by source

Subset enrichList for top enrichment results by source
}
\details{
This function takes one \code{enrichResult} object, or
a \code{data.frame} of enrichment results, and determines the
top \code{n} number of pathways sorted by P-values, within
each pathway source. This function may optionally require
\code{min_count} genes in each pathway, and \code{p_cutoff} maximum
enrichment P-value, prior to taking the top \code{topEnrichN}
entries. The default arguments do not apply filters
to \code{min_count} and \code{p_cutoff}.

When the enrichment data represents pathways from multiple
sources, the filtering and sorting is applied to each source
independently. The intent is to retain the top entries from
each source, as a method of representing each source
consistently even when one source may contain many more
pathways, and importantly where the range of enrichment P-values
may be very different for each source. For example, a database
of small canonical pathways would generally provide less
statistically significant P-values than a database of
dysregulated genes from gene expression experiments, where
each set contains a large number of genes.

This function can optionally apply basic curation of pathway
source names, and can optionally be applied to multiple
source columns. This feature is intended for sources like
MSigDB (see http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp)
which contains columns \code{"Source"} and \code{"Category"},
and where canonical pathways are either represented with \code{"CP"}
or a prefix \code{"CP:"}. The default parameters recognize this
case and curates all prefix \code{"CP:.*"} down to just \code{"CP"}
so that all canonical pathways are considered to be the
same source. For MSigDB there are also numerous other sources,
which are each independently filtered and sorted to the
top \code{topEnrichN} entries.

Finally, this function is useful to subset enrichment results
by name, using \code{descriptionGrep} or \code{nameGrep}.

\code{topEnrichListBySource()} extends \code{topEnrichBySource()} by applying
filters to each \code{enrichList} entry, then keeping pathways
across all \code{enrichList} that match the filter criteria in any
one \code{enrichList}. It is most useful in the context of
\code{multiEnrichMap()} where a pathway must meet all criteria
in at least one enrichment, and that pathway should then
be included for all enrichments for the purpose of
comparative analysis.
