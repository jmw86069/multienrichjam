the object is expected to contain \code{colorV}, \code{enrichIM},
\code{memIM}, \code{geneIM}.}

\item{do_which}{integer vector of plots to produce. When \code{do_which}
is \code{NULL}, then all plots are produced. This argument is intended
to help produce one plot from a folio, therefore each plot is referred
by the number of the plot, in order.}

\item{p_cutoff}{numeric value indicating the enrichment P-value threshold
used for \code{multiEnrichMap()}, but when \code{NULL} this value is taken
from the \code{mem} input, or \code{0.05} is used by default.}

\item{p_floor}{numeric value indicating the lowest enrichment P-value
used in the color gradient on the Enrichment Heatmap.}

\item{main}{character string used as a title on Cnet plots.}

\item{use_raster}{logical indicating whether to use raster heatmaps,
passed to \code{ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()}.}

\item{min_gene_ct, min_set_ct}{integer values passed to
\code{mem_gene_path_heatmap()}. The \code{min_gene_ct} requires each set
to contain \code{min_gene_ct} genes, and \code{min_set_ct} requires each gene
to be present in at least \code{min_set_ct} sets.}

\item{min_set_ct_each}{minimum number of genes required for each set,
required for at least one enrichment test.}

\item{column_method, row_method}{arguments passed to
\code{ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()} which indicate the distance method used
to cluster columns and rows, respectively.}

\item{exemplar_range}{integer vector (or \code{NULL}) used to create Cnet
exemplar plots, using this many exemplars per cluster.}

\item{pathway_column_split, gene_row_split}{\code{integer} value passed
as \code{column_split} and \code{row_split}, respectively, to
\code{mem_gene_path_heatmap()}, indicating the number of pathway
clusters, and gene clusters, to create in the gene-pathway heatmap.
When either value is \code{NULL} then auto-split logic is used.}

\item{pathway_column_title, gene_row_title}{\code{character} vectors
passed to \code{mem_gene_path_heatmap()} as \code{column_title} and
\code{row_title}, respectively. When one value is supplied, it is
displayed and centered across all the respective splits. When
multiple values are supplied, values are used to the number
of splits, and recycled as needed. In that case, repeated
values are made unique by \code{jamba::makeNames()}.}

\item{cex.main, cex.sub}{numeric values passed to \code{title()} which
size the default title and sub-title in Cnet plots.}

\item{row_cex, column_cex}{\code{numeric} character expansion factor, used
to adjust the relative size of row and column labels,
respectively. A value of \code{1.1} will make row font size 10\%
larger.}

\item{color_by_column}{\code{logical} indicating whether to colorize
the enrichment heatmap columns using \code{colorV} in the input \code{mem}.
This argument is only relevant when \code{do_which} include \code{1}.}

pathways within Cnet clusters. This argument is passed
to \code{rank_mem_clusters()}.}

\item{edge_bundling}{\code{character} string passed to \code{jam_igraph()}
to control edge bundling. The default \code{edge_bundling="connections"}
will bundle Cnet plot edges for genes that share the same pathway
connections.}

\item{apply_direction}{\code{logical} or \code{NULL} indicating whether to
indicate directionality in the \code{mem_enrichment_heatmap()} which is
the first plot in the series. The default \code{apply_direction=NULL}
will auto-detect whether there is directionality present in the
data, and will set \code{apply_direction=TRUE} only when there are non-NA
values that differ from zero.}

\item{do_plot}{\code{logical} indicating whether to render each plot.
When \code{do_plot=FALSE} the plot objects will be created and returned,

gene-pathway heatmap.}
}
\value{
\code{list} is returned via \code{invisible()}, which contains each
plot object enabled by the argument \code{do_which}:
\itemize{
\item \code{enrichment_hm} is a Heatmap object from \code{ComplexHeatmap}
that contains the enrichment P-value heatmap. Note that this
data is not used directly in subsequent plots, the pathway
clusters shown here are based upon \code{-log10(Pvalue)} and not
the underlying gene content of each pathway. This plot is
a useful overview that answers the question "How many
pathways are significantly enriched across the different
enrichment tests?"
\item \code{gp_hm} is a Heatmap object from \code{ComplexHeatmap} with
the gene-pathway incidence matrix heatmap. This heatmap and
the column/pathway clusters are the subject of subsequent
Cnet plots.
\item \code{gp_hm_caption} is a text caption that describes the gene
and set filter criteria, and the row and column distance methods
used for clustering. Because the filtering and clustering
options have substantial impact on clustering, and the
pathway clusters are the key for all subsequent plots,
these values are important to keep associated with the
output of this function.
\item \code{clusters_mem} is a \code{list} with the pathways contained
in each pathway cluster shown by the gene-pathway heatmap,
obtained by \code{heatmap_column_order(gp_hm)}. The pathway names
should also be present in \code{colnames(mem$memIM)} and
\code{rownames(mem$enrichIM)}, for follow-up inspection.
\item \code{cnet_collapsed} is an \code{igraph} object with Cnet plot data,
where the pathways have been collapsed by cluster, using the
gene-pathway heatmap clusters defined in \code{clusters_mem}. Each
pathway cluster is labeled by cluster name, and the first few
pathway names.
This data can be plotted using \code{jam_igraph(cnet_collapsed)}.
\item \code{cnet_collapsed_set} is the same as \code{cnet_collapsed} except the
pathways are labeled by the cluster name only, for example
\code{c("A", "B", "C", "D")}.
This data can be plotted using \code{jam_igraph(cnet_collapsed_set)}.
\item \code{cnet_collapsed_set2} is the same as \code{cnet_collapsed_set} except the
gene labels are hidden, useful when there are too many genes to label
clearly. The gene symbols are still stored in \code{V(g)$name} but the labels
in \code{V(g)$label} are updated to hide the genes.
This data can be plotted using \code{jam_igraph(cnet_collapsed_set2)}.
\item \code{cnet_exemplars} is a \code{list} of \code{igraph} Cnet objects, each
one contains only the number of exemplar pathways from each cluster
defined by argument \code{exemplar_range}. By default it uses \code{1} exemplar
per cluster, then \code{2} exemplars per cluster, then \code{3} exemplars
per cluster. A number of published figures use \code{1} exemplar per
pathway cluster.
This data can be plotted using \code{jam_igraph(cnet_exemplars[[1]])},
which will plot only the first \code{igraph} object from the list.
\item \code{cnet_clusters} is a \code{list} of \code{igraph} Cnet objects, each one
contains all the pathways in one pathway cluster.
This data can be plotted using \code{jam_igraph(cnet_clusters[[1]])},
or by calling a specific cluster \code{jam_igraph(cnet_clusters[["A"]])}.

\description{
Multienrichment folio of summary plots
}
\details{
This function is intended to create multiple summary plots
using the output data from \code{multiEnrichMap()}. By default
it creates all plots one by one, sufficient for including
in a multi-page PDF document with \code{cairo_pdf(..., onefile=TRUE)}
or \code{pdf(..., onefile=TRUE)}.

The data for each plot object can be created and visualized later
with argument \code{do_plot=FALSE}.

Note: Since version \verb{0.0.76.900} the first step in the workflow is
to cluster the underlying gene-pathway incidence matrix.
This step defines a consistent dendrogram driven by underlying
gene content in each pathway.
The dendrogram is used by each subsequent plot
including the enrichment heatmap.

There are two recommended strategies for visualizing multienrichment
results:
\enumerate{
\item Pathway clusters viewed as a concept network (Cnet) plot.
\itemize{
\item Given numerous statistically enriched pathways,
this process defines pathway clusters using the underlying gene-pathway
incidence matrix.
\item Within each pathway cluster, the pathways typically share a
high proportion of the same genes, and therefore are expected
to represent very similar functions. Ideally, each cluster represents
some distinct biological function, or a functional theme.
\item Benefit: Reducing a large number of pathways to a small number
of clusters greatly improves the options for visualization,
while retaining a comprehensive view of all genes and pathways
involved.
\item Benefit: This option is recommended when there are numerous pathways,
and when including more pathways is beneficial to understanding
the overall functional effects of the experimental study.
\item Limitation: The downside with this approach is that sometimes this
comprehensive content can be too much detail to interpret in one
figure, overshadowing individual pathways in each cluster.
\item Limitation: It may be difficult to recognize a functional theme for
each pathway cluster, unfortunately that process is not (yet) automated
and requires some domain expertise of the pathways and
functions involved.
\item Limitation: It may not be possible for one Cnet plot to represent all
functional effects of an experimental study.
}
\item Exemplar pathways are viewed as a Cnet plot.
\itemize{
\item As described above, given numerous statistically enriched pathways,
pathways are clustered using the gene-pathway incidence matrix. One
"exemplar" pathway is selected from each cluster to represent the typical
pathway content in each cluster, usually the most significant pathway in
the cluster, but optionally the pathway containing the most total genes.
\item Benefit: This process can produce a cleaner figure than Option 1
PathwayClusters, because fewer pathways and their associated genes are
included in the figure.
\item Limitation: This cleaner figure is understandably somewhat
less comprehensive, and may be subject to bias when selecting
exemplar pathways. However the selection of relevant pathways may
be very effective within the context of the experimental study.
\item Benefit: The resulting Cnet plot can often improve focus on specific
genes and pathways, which can be advantageous when including numerous
"synonyms" for the same or similar pathways is not beneficial.
\item Benefit: This strategy also works particularly well when there are
relatively few enriched pathways, or when argument \code{topEnrichN} used
with \code{multiEnrichMap()} was relatively small.

The folio of plots includes:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Enrichment Heatmap}, using enrichment P-values via
\code{mem_enrichment_heatmap()}. Plot #1.
\item \strong{Gene-Pathway Incidence Matrix Heatmap} using \code{mem_gene_path_heatmap()}.
This step visualizes the pathway clustering to be used by all
other plots in the folio. Plot #2.
\item \strong{Cnet Cluster Plot} representing Gene-Pathway clusters as a network,
created using \code{collapse_mem_clusters()}, then plotted with \code{jam_igraph()}.
Plots #3, #4, and #5.
\item \strong{Cnet Exemplar Plots} using exemplar pathways from each
gene-pathway cluster, with increase number of exemplars included
from each cluster (n per cluster). Cnet \code{igraph} objects are created
using \code{subsetCnetIgraph()}, then plotted with \code{jam_graph()}.
Plots #6, #7, and #8.
\item \strong{Cnet Individual Cluster Plots} with one plot for each gene-pathway
cluster defined above, including all pathways within the cluster.
These plots are mostly useful when a particular cluster may
have multiple sub-clusters included together. The plots can be useful
to understand the relationship between pathways in each cluster.
Plots #9, #10, and so on, length equal to \code{pathway_column_split}.
}

The specific plots to be created are controlled with \code{do_which}:
\itemize{
\item \code{do_which=1} will create the enrichment heatmap.
\item \code{do_which=2} will create the gene-pathway heatmap.
\item \code{do_which=3} will create the Cnet Cluster Plot using
pathway cluster labels for each pathway node, by default it uses \code{LETTERS}:
\verb{"A", "B", "C", "D"}, etc.
\item \code{do_which=4} will create the Cnet Cluster Plot using abbreviated
pathway labels for each pathway cluster node.
\item \code{do_which=5} will create the Cnet Cluster Plot with no node labels.
\item \code{do_which=6} begins the series of Cnet Exemplar Plots for each value
in argument \code{exemplar_range}, whose default is \code{c(1, 2, 3)}.
\item \code{do_which=9} (by default) begins the series of Cnet individual
cluster plots, which includes all pathways from each cluster.
}

The most frequently used plots are \code{do_which=2} for the
gene-pathway heatmap, and \code{do_which=4} for the collapsed Cnet
plot, where Cnet clusters are based upon the gene-pathway heatmap.

Arguments \code{p_cutoff} and \code{min_set_ct_each} can be used to
apply more stringent thresholds than the original \code{mem} data.
For example, applying \code{p_cutoff=0.05} during \code{multiEnrichMap()}
will colorize pathways in \code{mem$enrichIMcolors}, however when
calling \code{mem_plot_folio()} with \code{p_cutoff=0.001} will use blank
color in the color gradient for pathways that do not
have \code{mem$enrichIM} value at or below \code{0.001}.

Our experience is that the pathway clustering does not need to
be perfect to be useful and valid. The pathway clusters
are valid based upon the parameters used for clustering,
and provide insight into the genes that help define each
cluster distinct from other clusters.
Sometimes the clustering results are more or less effective
based upon the type of pattern observed in the data, so it
can be helpful to adjust parameters to drill down to
the most effective patterns.
}
\section{Gene-Pathway clustering}{
The clustering is performed by combining the gene-pathway incidence
matrix \code{mem$memIM} with the \code{-log10(mem$enrichIM)} enrichment P-values.
The relative weight of each matrix is controlled by
\code{enrich_im_weight}, where \code{enrich_im_weight=0} assigns weight=0
to the enrichment P-values, and thus clusters only using the
gene-pathway matrix. Similarly, \code{enrich_im_weight=1} will assign
full weight to the enrichment P-value matrix, and will ignore
the gene-pathway matrix data.

The corresponding weight for gene (rows) is controlled by
\code{gene_im_weight}, which balances row clustering with the
\code{mem$geneIM} matrix, and the gene-pathway matrix \code{mem$memIM}.

The argument \code{column_method} defines the distance method,
for example \code{"euclidean"} and \code{"binary"} are two immediate choices.
The method also adds \code{"correlation"} from \code{amap::hcluster()} which
can be very useful especially with large datasets.

The number of pathway clusters is controlled by
\code{pathway_column_split}, by default when \code{pathway_column_split=NULL}
and \code{auto_cluster=TRUE} the number of clusters is defined based
upon the total number of pathways. In practice, \code{pathway_column_split=4}
or \code{pathway_column_split=3} is recommended, as this number of
clusters is most convenient to visualize as a Cnet plot.

To define your own pathway cluster labels, define \code{pathway_column_title}
as a vector with length equal to \code{pathway_column_split}. These labels
become network node labels in subsequent plots, and in the
resulting \code{igraph} object.

The pathway clusters are dependent upon the genes and pathways
used during clustering, which are also controlled by
\code{min_set_ct} and \code{min_gene_ct}.
\itemize{
\item \code{min_set_ct} filters the matrix by the number of times a Set is
represented in the matrix,
which can be helpful when there are pathways with large number of
genes, with some pathways with very low number of genes.
\item \code{min_gene_ct} filters the matrix by the number of times a gene is
represented in the matrix. It can be helpful for requiring a gene
be represented in more than one enriched pathway.
\item \code{min_set_ct_each} filters the matrix to require each Set to
contain at least this many entries from one enrichment result,
rather than using the combined incidence matrix. It is mostly
helpful to increase the value used in \code{multiEnrichMap()} argument
\code{min_count}, which already filters pathways for minimum number
of genes involved.
\item Note: These filters are only recommended when the gene-pathway
matrix is very large, perhaps 100 pathways, or 500 genes.
}
}

\section{Cnet pathway clusters}{
The resulting Cnet pathway clusters are single nodes in the
network, and these nodes are colorized based upon the enrichment
tests involved. The threshold for including the color for
each enrichment test is defined by \code{cluster_color_min_fraction},
which requires at least this fraction of pathways in a
pathway cluster meets the significance criteria for that
enrichment test.

To adjust the coloration filter to include any enrichment
test with at least one significant result, use
\code{cluster_color_min_fraction=0.01}.
In the gene-pathway heatmap,
these colors are shown across the top of the heatmap.
The default \code{cluster_color_min_fraction=0.4} requires 40\%
of pathways in a cluster for each enrichment test.

Note: Prior to version \verb{0.0.76.900}
the enrichment heatmap was clustered only using enrichment
P-values, transformed with \code{log10(Pvalue)}. The clustering was
inconsistent with other plots in the folio, and was not effective
at clustering pathways based upon similar content, which is the
primary goal of the \code{multienrichjam} R package.
