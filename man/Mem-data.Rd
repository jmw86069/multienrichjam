\format{
\code{Memtest} is a \code{Mem} multi-enrichment object including two
enrichment tests 'Newborns' and 'OlderChildren'

\code{Reese_genes} is a \code{list} with names 'Newborns' and 'OlderChildren',
each with a \code{character} vector of gene symbols, named by ENTREZID,
representing genes associated with each cohort.
For example, the \code{names(Reese_genes$Newborns)} may be useful for
pathway enrichment methods that expect Entrez gene ID as input.

Data used for multi-enrichment analysis as described in

It is provided for convenient testing of multienrichjam.

\details{
Memtest is a \code{Mem} object with enrichment results
for 'Newborns' and 'OlderChildren'.

A minor change was made to published data:
\itemize{
\item Gene symbols were updated to current Entrez gene symbols
as of November 2025. This process changed 'INADL' to 'PATJ'
in the enrichment results.
\item Two additional genes were updated in 'geneHitIM' for genes
not present in the IPA pathway results.
\item The \code{Reese_genes} data were also updated for consistency,
and to ensure that the \code{names(Reese_genes)} using Entrez ID
would be consistent with the gene symbols shown.
Finally, the genes in \code{Reese_genes} should be usable for
other pathway enrichment tests.
