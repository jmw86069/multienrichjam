\arguments{
\item{enrichList}{\code{list} of \code{enrichResult} objects, whose
names are used in subsequent derived results.}

\item{enrichLabels}{\code{character} vector of enrichment labels to use,
as an optional alternative to \code{names(enrichList)}.}

\item{geneHitList}{\code{list} of character vectors, or
\code{list} of \code{numeric} vectors whose names represent genes, or
or \code{NULL}. When \code{NULL} the gene hit list for each enrichment
result is inferred from the enrichment results themselves,
however this option may incompletely represent which genes
were statistical hits.
Note that \code{geneHitList} and \code{geneHitIM} serve the same purpose
and either can be supplied.}

\item{geneHitIM}{\code{numeric} matrix with gene rows, enrichment columns,
and \code{numeric} values indicating the presence and/or direction
of change for each gene.
Note that \code{geneHitList} and \code{geneHitIM} serve the same purpose
and either can be supplied.}

\item{colorV}{\code{character} vector of colors, length
equal to \code{length(enrichList)},
used to assign specific colors to each enrichment result.}

\item{enrichNumLimit}{\code{numeric} value indicating the \code{-log10(P-value)}
above which each color gradient is considered the maximum color,
useful to apply a fixed threshold for each color gradient.}

\item{nEM}{\code{integer} number, to define the maximum number of pathway
nodes to include in the EnrichMap \code{igraph} network. This argument
is passed to \code{enrichMapJam()}.}

\item{descriptionCurateFn}{\code{function} default \code{fixSetLabels()} used to
curate pathway description to a user-friendly label.
When \code{NULL} this step is skipped.}

\item{geneDelim}{\code{character} pattern used with \code{strsplit()} to
split multiple gene values into a list of vectors. The default
for \code{enrichResult} objects is \code{"/"}, but the default for other
sources is often \code{","}. The default pattern \code{"[,/ ]+"} splits
by either \code{"/"}, \code{","}, or whitespace \code{" "}.}

\item{returnType}{\code{character} default "Mem" output class:
\itemize{
\item 'Mem' returns Mem S4 object
\item 'list' returns legacy list format (deprecated)
}}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical} indicating whether to print verbose output.
For \code{verbose} to cascade to internal functions, use \code{verbose=2}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are passed to internal functions.
\itemize{
\item \code{topEnrichListBySource()} used to take the top \code{topEnrichN}
pathways from each enrichment, and may also be used to subset
by other criteria such as \code{descriptionGrep}, \code{nameGrep},
\code{sourceSubset}, \code{subsetSets}, etc.
}}

\item{nrow, ncol, byrow}{optional arguments used to customize
\code{igraph} node shape \code{"coloredrectangle"}, useful when the
number of \code{enrichList} results is larger than around 4. It
defines the number of columns and rows used for each node,
to display enrichment result colors, and whether to fill
colors by row when \code{byrow=TRUE}, or by column when \code{byrow=FALSE}.}

\item{subsetSets}{\code{character} vector of optional set names to
use in the analysis, useful to analyze only a specific subset
of known pathways.}

\item{overlapThreshold}{\code{numeric} value between 0 and 1, indicating
the Jaccard overlap score above which two pathways will be linked
in the EnrichMap \code{igraph} network. By default, pathways whose
genes overlap more than \code{0.1} will be connected, which is roughly
equivalent to about a 10\% overlap. Note that the Jaccard coefficient
is adversely affected when pathway sets differ in size by more than
about 5-fold.}

\item{cutoffRowMinP}{\code{numeric} value between 0 and 1, indicating the
enrichment P-value required by at least one enrichment result, to
be retained in downstream analyses. This P-value can be confirmed
in the returned list element \code{"enrichIM"}, which is a matrix of
P-values by pathway and enrichment.}

\item{enrichBaseline}{\code{numeric} value indicating the \code{-log10(P-value)}
at which colors are defined as non-blank in color gradients.
This value is typically derived from \code{cutoffRowMinP} to ensure
that colors are only applied when a pathway meets this significance
threshold.}

\item{enrichLens}{\code{numeric} value indicating the "lens" to apply to
color gradients, where numbers above 0 make the color ramp more
compressed, so colors are more vivid at lower numeric values.}

\item{topEnrichN}{\code{integer} value with the maximum rows to retain
from each \code{enrichList} table, by source. Set \code{topEnrichN=0} or
\code{topEnrichN=NULL} to disable subsetting for the top rows.}

\item{pathGenes, geneHits}{\code{character} values indicating the colnames
that contain the number of pathway genes, and the number of gene
hits, respectively.}
}
\value{
\code{list} object containing various result formats:
\itemize{
\item colorV: named vector of colors assigned to each enrichment,
where names match the names of each enrichment in \code{enrichList}.

\description{
Prepare MultiEnrichMap data from enrichList (In progress)

\details{
This function performs most of the work of comparing multiple
enrichment results.
This function takes a list of \code{enrichResult} objects,
generates an overall pathway-gene incidence matrix, assembles
a pathway-to-Pvalue matrix, creates EnrichMap \code{igraph} network
objects, and CnetPlot \code{igraph} network objects. It also applies
node shapes and colors consistent with the colors used for
each enrichment result.

By default, each enrichment result table is subsetted for the
top \code{n=20} pathways sorted by pathway source, defined by
colnames \code{c("Source", "Category")}. For data without a source
column, the overall enrichment results are sorted to take the
top 20. Once the top 20 from each enrichment table are selected,
the overall set of pathways are used to retain these pathways
from all enrichment tables. In this way, a significant enrichment
result from one table will still be compared to a non-significant
result from another table.

The default values for \code{topEnrichN} and related arguments
are intended when using enrichment results from \code{MSigDB},
which has colnames \code{c("Source","Category")} and represents
100 or more combinations of sources and categories. The
default values will select the top 20 entries from the
canonical pathways, after curating the canonical pathway
categories to one \code{"CP"} source value.

To disable the top pathway filtering, set \code{topEnrichN=0}.

Colors can be defined for each enrichment result using the
argument \code{colorV}, otherwise colors are assigned using
\code{colorjam::rainbowJam()}.
