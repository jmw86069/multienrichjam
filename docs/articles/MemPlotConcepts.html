</h2>
<p>In practice, we rarely find benefit from the multi-enrichment map.
The network shows pathways connected to pathways based upon Jaccard
overlap of the genes involved in enrichment of each pathway.</p>
<p>This network view was often disorganized, not clearly clustered, and
lacked ability to see which genes drive the overlaps between
pathways.</p>
<p>Perhaps it works best for the highly structured Gene Ontology (GO),
but in our hands GO was just not insightful for the broad range of
experiments we were analyzing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="concept-networks-cnet">Concept networks (Cnet)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#concept-networks-cnet"></a>
</h2>
<p>We gravitated toward the Cnet plot, a clever idea by Dr. Guangchang
Yu to visualize pathways connected to genes, where genes also connect
naturally to other pathways.</p>
<p>For many of our collaborators, this plot is visually intuitive. It
also answers the next question people often have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What are the shared genes?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our subtle customization is to color genes by enrichment to show
which genes are shared or unique across enrichments.</p>
<p>The gene nodes are sorted by color, and optionally by border, to help
organize patterns.</p>

<h3 id="two-cnet-paradigms">Two Cnet paradigms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#two-cnet-paradigms"></a>
</h3>
<p>The evolution of Cnet plots led to two conceptual ideas, both driven
by the “too many pathways” problem:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p><strong>Cnet using “exemplar pathways”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This option is not comprehensive, as it only shows a subset of
pathways.</li>
<li>This option will not show every gene involved in enrichment.</li>
<li>Its main utility is to produce a clean figure. Ultimately, this is
also a core goal of multienrichjam.</li>
<li>This option is ideal when there are relevant pathways known to be
relevant to the experiment, and when Option 2 (below) is too
complex.</li>
<li>Option 1 is the path chosen by the <code>ggtangle</code> component
of the <code>clusterProfiler</code> suite by Dr. Yu. It displays the top
N pathways, with default <code>showCategory=5</code>. In our experience,
the “top N” are not always the most representative, nor the most
interesting. So we extended multienrichjam accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cnet using pathway clusters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This option is intended to be more comprehensive, less complex than
plotting 20 pathways individually, but more complex than “Cnet
exemplars” above.</li>
<li>This option will show every gene involved in enrichment.</li>
<li>This option is the main utility of multienrichjam.</li>
<li>Pathways are clustered based upon the genes they contain. The
approach is similar to Enrichment Map (Bader lab) use of Jaccard
overlap. However, clustering is a rich field with many important
techniques not captured by a simple overlap coefficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 2 has several important benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduces redundancy among pathways.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When the genes involved in pathway enrichment are identical across
several pathways, they naturally cluster together.</li>
<li>Over much time, we observed that gene-pathway clustering provides a
rich overview of the data involved, and gives insight into the
underlying pathways and supporting data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoids clustering by P-value</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To be frank, our original approach was to plot the P-value matrix of
test versus pathway. As a heatmap, it naturally provides clusters, and
it sometimes fortuitously appears biologically relevant.</li>
<li>
<strong>We learned that clustering by P-value is incorrect.</strong>
Instead, we recommend using the underlying gene content of the pathways.
The purpose is to group pathways conceptually, and enrichment P-value is
not an indication of biology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provides functional sub-groups for
interpretation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, nearly identical pathways are grouped together and are
“easily summarized” by a scientist.</li>
<li>More often, pathway clusters contain similar pathways, grouped
because they also share “core genes” across these pathways.</li>
<li>This is an exciting finding in itself, and turns out to be the major
step forward in interpreting pathway enrichment findings. Unfortunately,
it doesn’t provide an “easy summary” to use as a label.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="guidance">Guidance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#guidance"></a>
</h3>
<p>Frankly, neither approach is always comprehensive. Whether
comforting, or not, no analysis is itself comprehensive, especially
considering the pathway (gene set) resources are themselves imperfect.
Rarely are all genes tested for enrichment also present in the pathways
being tested, nor present in statistically significant pathways
found.</p>
<p>Cnet plots typically cannot show all functionally relevant genes from
an experiment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all functionally relevant genes are annotated.</li>
<li>Not all functionally relevant genes are assigned to a known pathway
or gene set.</li>
<li>Not all pathways to which a gene is assigned meet statistical
thresholds for enrichment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary purpose of a Cnet plot is to visualize the relationship
between pathways and genes*, with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for pathways that met the filtering criteria as tested.</p></li>
<li><p>for genes that were associated with those pathways.</p></li>
<li>
<p>for pathways arranged in one of two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Cnet exemplars, representing a subset of pathways which are relevant
to the particular research study.</li>
<li>Cnet clusters, representing functional groups of pathways based upon
shared genes in those pathways.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The secondary purpose of a Cnet plot is to allow scientists to review
the specific genes involved, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the relationship of genes to one or more pathways, and</li>
<li>the association of genes with one or more enrichment tests.</li>
</ul>
